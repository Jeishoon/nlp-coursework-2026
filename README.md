# Imperial College London Natural Language Processing Coursework 2026

This coursework explores the use of a RoBERTa ensemble for Patronizing and Condescending Language (PCL) detection.

- Due to the large size of RoBERTa models, they are not present within the best models folder, but the notebook to train and run these models is present
- Predictions for the dev set and test set are found in their corresponding text files in the predictions folder

The work in this repository was done in Google Colab. As such, the notebooks must be run in a simialr environment. The setup requires that the datasets and splits used in the notebook are stored in a "pcl_datasets/" folder in the mounted Google Drive.
